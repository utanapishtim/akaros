/* General idea: if we're at the base for this func (base of ERRSTACK in the
 * scope where ERRSTACK and waserror are used), we need to find and save the
 * previous errbuf, so we know how to pop back.
 *
 * The main goal of this is to track and advertise (via pcpui) the errbuf that
 * should be jumped to next (when we call error()).  Note that the caller of
 * this (waserror()) will fill the jumpbuf shortly with its context.
 *
 * When we enter, curindex points to the slot we should use.  First time, it is
 * 0, and we'll set cur_eb to slot 0.  When we leave, curindex is set to the
 * next free slot. */
